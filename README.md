# Project 2: Intel Sustainability Journey

As part of the Global Career Accelerator, this project involved building a fully responsive website that presents Intel’s sustainability milestones in an interactive timeline format. Designed with accessibility and localization in mind, the site supports real-time translation into all languages via Google Translate — including right-to-left (RTL) scripts like Arabic — making the experience globally accessible.

Key features include hover animations, smooth transitions, and layout adjustments that respond dynamically to language direction and screen size using **Bootstrap**.
